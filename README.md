# Java Project Definitions - Paired Project

## Jurassic Park

Goal: Create a web application in Spark with Hibernate/Java back end

You have been asked to create a web app to allow the management in Jurassic Park manage the dinosaur population and visitor tracking of Jurassic Park. (No expense spared)

### MVP

The user must be able to add paddocks, add / remove dinosaurs to paddocks, feed dinosaurs. You should also be able to transfer Herbivores between paddocks. :/


### Project Extensions

* Dinosaurs marked as herbivores can live in the same paddock but those marked as carnivores can only be placed with dinosaurs of the same type.
* Dinosaurs can randomly rampage and break out of their paddocks.
* Visitors can enter / exit the park if the dinosaurs are not rampaging.
* View the number of visitors in the park at a given time.
* Be able to search for Dinosaurs within the park.
* Quiz?
