# Java Project Definitions - Paired Project

## Jurassic Park

Goal: Create a web application in Spark with Hibernate/Java back end

You have been asked to create a web app to allow the management in Jurassic Park manage the dinosaur population and visitor tracking of Jurassic Park. (No expense spared)

### MVP

The user must be able to add paddocks, add / remove dinosaurs to paddocks, feed dinosaurs. You should also be able to transfer Herbivores between paddocks. :/


### Project Extensions

* Dinosaurs marked as herbivores can live in the same paddock but those marked as carnivores can only be placed with dinosaurs of the same type.
* Dinosaurs can randomly rampage and break out of their paddocks.
* Visitors can enter / exit the park if the dinosaurs are not rampaging.
* View the number of visitors in the park at a given time.
* Anything else you can dream up!

## Totally *not* Gumtree

Goal: Create a web application in Spark with Hibernate/Java back end.
### MVP
You are required to write a web application for a company listing classified ads. The company would like to give users of their site
the ability to create and post adverts to their listings.
Adverts should require a Title, Description, category and asking price.

Users should be able to:
- Log in to the site to view all adverts posted by other users. (No passwords needed just a username)
- View all adverts in a category.
- Create and post adverts to specific categories.
- Delete their own adverts.

### Project Extensions

* Post comments on adverts.
* Allow users to mark adverts as favourite so that they can view all favourited ads in one page.


## SGNN News

What'**s** **G**oi**n**' O**n** News have asked you to build a web application to allow them to upload the latest Scottish news.

They want to be able to:

- Add, Edit and Remove Journalists
- Add, Edit and Remove Articles

For the front end of the website, users should be able to:

- View a list of articles, ordered by date. (Newest first!)
- Click through to the full story

(Each Article might have a headline, summary paragraph, and the full story - and any other fields you want to add.)

## Possible Extensions

- Search for articles where the title includes a particular search term
- Filter articles by journalist
- Filter articles by category, which can be added by SGNN
- Track how many times an article has been read, and display a list of most popular articles
- _Paginate_ your article list - display a certain number of articles per page, with a page number, and navigation to go to the next and previous page

And other any extensions you would like to add.

## Do What You Like

If none of the other project ideas float your ⛵️, you can take on a project of your own.

Your project must meet the following specification:

- It must be a Hibernate / Spark web app
- It must contain a number of associations between classes - one to many, many to many etc.
- It must contain some custom logic - this could be filtering, sorting etc.
- As with the other projects, it must not contain any JavaScript or use any other frameworks.

Before you start this project, write an MVP and potential extensions. You **must** get this signed off by an instructor before proceeding.

## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.
